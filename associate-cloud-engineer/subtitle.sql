Let’s start with how to set up
Cymbal Superstore’s cloud environment. Cymbal Superstore is ready to start implementing
basic cloud infrastructure for their organization. As an Associate Cloud Engineer,
you have been assigned to the team to help with this phase of the project. The team begins with a planning
meeting to decide how Cymbal Superstore’s cloud structure
will be organized. The outcomes of this phase of the migration journey
include establishing a resource hierarchy, implementing organizational policies,
managing projects and quotas, managing users and groups,
and applying access management. Setting up billing and monitoring the use
of your cloud resources are also things to consider. Let’s take a closer look. How to set up a resource hierarchy
on Google Cloud depends on the needs and structure
of the organization. Cymbal Superstore plans to migrate
three applications to the cloud: its supply chain application,
which will run on VMs; its containerized ecommerce application,
which will use GKE; and its transportation management
application, which will use Cloud Run functions
to track truck location. These applications correspond to
three different departments. Operations manages the B2B supply chain, Logistics oversees transportation, and Sales & Marketing manages
the eCommerce application. The graphic shows a possible organizational
hierarchy for Cymbal Superstore. The Cymbal Superstore organization is at the
top, followed by optional folders underneath, one for each division and
one for each application. There are multiple projects under the B2B
supply chain app folder, one for each environment related to
continuous integration/continuous delivery: a development, staging,
and production environment. Other apps in the chart would have a similar
project structure. As you set up the hierarchy, you will also
need to grant organizational policies. For example, Marketing might need to access
the data in the supply chain system to see if inventory levels affected
recent marketing campaigns. Giving Marketing viewer permissions on the
supply chain production environment might be a good choice to give them
the access they need. An Associate Cloud Engineer could
also be tasked with enabling Application Programming Interfaces (API’s)
within projects during setup. Cymbal Superstore’s ecommerce project requires
access to Google Kubernetes Engine and Cloud SQL as a database backend and
you’ll need to enable the APIs for those services. Setting up the cloud environment also
involves granting members IAM roles to ensure that they have the right
access to projects depending on their needs of their job
and role at Cymbal Superstore. For example, data analysts in the
Marketing department will need to have access to historic sales
data in the ecommerce system. This could be a great use case for BigQuery,
Google Cloud’s data warehouse solution. How would we go about giving proper access? New data analysts would need to be
added to the data_analyst group. Managing permissions and rules
at a group level is easier than keeping track of
permissions for individual users. Data analysts need to access the
data in the dataset or table, so they require the bigquery.dataViewer
role at the proper level. Queries in BigQuery are executed
as an executable job. So to submit a query, a data analyst would
also need the bigquery.jobs.create permission. This permission is included in the predefined
bigquery.user role. You would give the data_analyst group access
to this role in the Production project. As a cloud engineer, you’ll need to know
how to manage Cymbal Superstore’s users and groups in Cloud Identity,
a service for managing users and groups if you are not doing so via Google Workspace. Google Cloud Observability, which used to
be called Google Cloud’s operations suite and Stackdriver before that, provides metrics
and logging services for all of your services, resources, and projects in
your cloud architecture. To monitor metrics from multiple projects,
you set up project scoping. If Cymbal Superstore’s Operations department
decides to monitor metrics across all three supply chain projects in the staging environment
project, you will set staging as a scoping project and then add dev and
production as monitored projects. While migrating to Google Cloud, Cymbal Superstore
will be moving some of its IT expenditure to operational expenses, and different
departments associated with each application will be responsible for compute
and storage costs. You’ll need to create a different billing
account for each group and link each project to
the appropriate account. The department lead in Sales and Marketing
expresses particular concern about the cost of housing its data warehouse in BigQuery
and how to optimize queries and storage. You’ll need to set up custom billing budgets
and alerts for this department. Each department will also need you
to set up billing exports that can be used to track charges.
